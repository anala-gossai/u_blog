As noted previously, I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for school and work when doing statistical computing. I tend to prefer sharing nicely formatted HTMLs generated from analyses conducted in R using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). I was excited to learn that it was now possible to integrate "knitted" HTML output from an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (.Rmd) file to [my Hugo blog](https://anala-gossai.github.io/u_blog/) with the assistance of the new R package, [`blogdown`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/). 

### Quick start 

`blogdown` states that the *"main [blog platform] we support in `blogdown` is Hugo"*. I had previously set up [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for building this website before learning of the compatibility with R Markdown through `blogdown`. Thus, after installing the `blogdown` package using `install.packages("blogdown")`, I did **not** need to further run `blogdown::new_site()` to generate a new site. 

I then searched around for an example of an R Markdown file used in an active blog, and although I didn't find one that quite met my needs, I did find some useful internet posts on the topic of using R to generate blogposts [here](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/), [here](https://talesofr.wordpress.com/2017/08/18/starting-a-rmarkdown-blog-with-bookdown-hugo-github/), [here](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), and [here](https://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/).  

After setting up an R Markdown file for this blog post, I rendered the blog using `blogdown::serve_site("~/Users/analagossai/u_blog/content/post/my_third_post.Rmd")` typed into an R command line or program window.

#### Debugging 

As usual, my main problems during setup was relative URLs. Namely, I was interested in displaying HTML widgets and had trouble finding them to render in my Hugo blog. 

See below for a short example of my first blog post generated with `blogdown` and R Markdown!  

### R Markdown

This is an [R Markdown](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document published using Hugo. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 


```{r global_options, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width  = 9, 
                      fig.height = 5, 
                      echo       = TRUE, 
                      warning    = FALSE, 
                      message    = FALSE)

options(scipen = 999,
        expressions = 500000)
```


```{r packages_functions}

# source all functions available 
# from: https://github.com/anala-gossai/fun_ctions
sourceDir <- function(path, 
                      trace = TRUE, ...) {
    
    
    for (nm in list.files(path, pattern = "\\.[RrSsQq]$")) {
       if (trace) {
           source(file.path(path, nm), ...)
       }
    }
}


sourceDir("/Users/analagossai/fun_ctions")

#...........................................................#

# set the working directory to blog posts
setwd("/Users/analagossai/u_blog/content/post")
```


```{r get_data}

# get dataset provided by r
data(mtcars)
```

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

mtcars %>% 
    head() %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```


#### Including Plots

You can also embed plots (even HTML widgets with the assistance of `iframe`), for example: 

```{r}

iPlotDensity(data = mtcars,
             cts_var = "hp",
             group_var = "gear") %>% 
    uBlogSavePlot(file_name = "densityPlot")
``` 

<iframe seamless src="/figures/densityPlot.html" width="100%" height="500" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

### R Code Session Information   

Session information:
```{r ses_info}
sessionInfo()
```


Location of script used to generate this report:
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
getwd()
```
