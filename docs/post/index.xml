      <description>As noted previously, I use R for school and work when doing statistical computing. I tend to prefer sharing nicely formatted HTMLs generated from analyses conducted in R using R Markdown.

There are a number of packages I always load when starting an analysis:
 Everything in the tidyverse: the tidyverse includes packages that simplify data manipulation, data cleaning, data summarisation, and graphical representation of data.</description>

      <description>I spent a weekend building this static website that could host simple markdown documents or HTML outputs. Although I have some familiarity with using Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub Pages, I preferred the default aesthetics of Hugo with the Casper theme.
