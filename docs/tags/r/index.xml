      <description>As noted previously, I use R for school and work when doing statistical computing using biomedical data. I tend to prefer sharing nicely formatted HTMLs generated from analyses conducted in R using R Markdown. Therefore, I was excited to learn that it was now possible to integrate “knitted” HTML output from an R Markdown (.Rmd) file to my Hugo blog with the assistance of the new R package, blogdown.
Quick start blogdown states that the “main [blog platform] we support in blogdown is Hugo”.</description>

      <description>R is the statistical programming language I have used for a number of years in school and work as a Quantitative Biomedical Scientist. One reason I have enjoyed using R (particularly over SAS, but comparably to Python) is the large number of packages available for download to enhance the scope of analyses.
There are a set of packages I always load when starting an analysis:
 Everything in the tidyverse: the tidyverse includes packages that simplify data manipulation, data cleaning, data summarisation, and graphical representation of data.</description>
